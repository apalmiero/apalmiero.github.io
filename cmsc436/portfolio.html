    <h2>Portfolio Goals</h2>
    <p>The intent of the following portfolio is to showcase my growth and increased understanding of data visualization throughout the Spring 2025 semester. Additionally, I wanted an opportunity to explore coding in HTML and CSS, as I have not coded in either language before!</p>
        <p>&star; To achieve these goals, I will Refine + Reflect on two artifacts:<p>
        <p class = "indented">(1) Dear Data Postcard</p>
        <p class = "indented">(2) Original Card Game called Club Scrum</p>

    <p>&star; I will Curate + Reflect on two separate artifacts:</p>
        <p class = "indented">(1) Maps and Networks in-class activity</p>
        <p class = "indented">(2) Curate a guideline for Dashboard Best Practices </p>

    <p>&star; I will present the above material in a webpage designed in HTML and CSS</p>
    <p>My intent for choosing these specific artifacts were to demonstrate that data visualization can be creative, showcase work I am proud of, and reflect on my group's Final Release.</p>

    <h2>Refine + Reflect</h2>
        <p class = artifact>Dear Data Postcard</p>
            <p class = subsection>Reflection</p>
                <p class = subtext> This artifact is one I created for the purpose of the Final Portfolio. I chose to create a postcard inspired by the original Dear Data postcards because I appreciated the opportunity to delve deeper into artistic visualizations. Something I tend to find frustrating with technology is not being able to get it to do exactly what I envision. In this situation, I never know whether this limitation is due to the software itself, or my knowledge of it. However, making a postcard meant designing something by hand, so I knew the limitations of my own creative abilities from the start. This made creating this artifact enjoyable, and calming! Additionally, the design process was completely different from the other visualizations I created this semester. When looking at postcards from the original Dear Data creators, you may not be able to tell that some designs encode data at all. They were beautiful, and some were very artistic. So, for just a moment, I concerned myself with form just as much as function (bad, I know).
                    <br><br>
                    To complete this assignment, I used a software called GoodNotes, and recorded the data I encoded in Google Docs. GoodNotes is typically used for notetaking, but can also be used for drawing and low level digital design. This was my first experience using digital design for a school project. The program did an adequate job supporting my creation of the Dear Data Postcard, and I was pleasantly surprised. I was able to clone already created drawings, which helped eliminate any fear I had about my final product being imperfect. 
                    <br><br>
                    I chose to encode the data of which drinks I consumed over the course of a week. I chose this data because I thought it would be fun to visualize, and I was curious to see how much I spent on drinks over the course of one week. I was surprised to find that I drank 8 drinks in a week, and spent almost $71! I spent a lot more than I expected. I think tracking my drinking habits for a week was a good reminder to be mindful of my caffeine consumption, and spending.

        <p class = artifact>Card Game</p>
            <p class = subsection>Club Scrum</p>
                <p class = subtext>Club Scrum is a card game that can be played with a standard American 52 card deck. You are a Data Analyst for a large corporate company, and are working on a big presentation. Your goal is to match Mark and Channel cards to Task cards. Each successful match increases or decreases a player's point total. Like in real data visualization, some Mark and Channel combinations are more effective than others. Therefore, some combinations can earn a player more points than others. There are also bonus cards, called "Contractor Cards" that can substitute in for any missing Mark or Channel card, and help you finish your deliverable! This game was designed to recognize the realities of corporate Sprint culture, while still being simple and fun.
            <p class = subsection>Rules</p>
                    <p class = subtext> 
                        <bold>Suits represent different card types:</bold><br>
                        <p class = indentsubtext>&RightArrow; Hearts are Marks <br></p>
                        <p class = indentsubtext> &RightArrow; Diamonds are Channels <br></p>
                        <p class = indentsubtext>&RightArrow; Clubs are Tasks <br></p>
                        <p class = indentsubtext>&RightArrow; Spades are Contractor Cards <br><br></p>

                    <p class = subtext><bold>To prepare for gameplay:</bold><br> </p>
                        <p class = indentsubtext>1. Remove any Joker cards from your deck<br></p>
                        <p class = indentsubtext>2. Shuffle the deck well, and deal each player 9 cards <br></p>
                        <p class = indentsubtext>3. Take one card from the top of the deck, and place it face up to make the Discard Pile <br></p>
                        <p class = indentsubtext>4. Place the remaining cards in a pile face down, this will be the Draw Pile<br><br></p>

                    <p class = subtext><bold>To play the game:</bold><br>
                        <p class = subtext>&RightArrow; The player to the left of the dealer goes first. If there are only two players, the player who was not the dealer starts the game. <br> </p>
                        <p class = subtext>&RightArrow; At the start of your turn, you can do one of two things: <br></p>
                            <p class = indentsubtext>1. Draw a card from the top of the draw pile. </p>
                            <p class = indentsubtext>&star; If you draw a card from the top of the Draw Pile, you can play it immediately, or save it for later. <br></p>
                            <p class = indentsubtext>2. Take a card from the top of the Discard Pile.</p>
                            <p class = indentsubtext>&star; If a card is taken from the Discard Pile, it must immediately result in a match.</p>
                        <p class = subtext>&RightArrow; After choosing one of these two options, the player is now free to create matches. A match is made when a player has one Mark (Heart) and one Channel (Diamond) card that can be matched to a Task (Club) card.<br></p>
                        <p class = subtext>&RightArrow; Once a player has finished making matches, or passes the opportunity to make a match, one card must be discarded from their hand and placed to the top of the Discard Pile.<br></p>
                        <p class = subtext>&RightArrow; The round continues until one player has no cards left in their hand. Once this happens, each player tallies the points from their created matches. Then, players with cards remaining in their hand create any matches possible from their in hand cards. Final points from each round are calculated by subtracting the points from in-hand matches from the points of played matches.<br></p>
                            <p class = indentsubtext> For example, if a player has 10 points from created matches, and 3 &heartsuit; + 4 &spadesuit; + 8 &clubsuit; in their hand, they would subtract 3 points from their total (since the score of this match is 3 points). This player would end the round with 7 points. If there are no clubs in a players hand at the end of the round, no matches can be made, and 0 points are subtracted from the created match point amount.<br></p>
                        <p class = subtext>&RightArrow; The game ends when one player reaches 36 points, a nod to our class number, CMSC436! Multiple rounds can be played to reach a total of 36 points overall.<br></p>

                    <p class = subtext><bold>Match-Making Rules:</bold><br>
                    <p class = indentsubtext>A <boldred>Basic Match</boldred> requires 1 Heart card, 1 Diamond card, and 1 Club card of any value. This match awards +5 points.<br><br> &rightarrow; Basic Match: 5 &heartsuit; + 7 &diamondsuit; + J &clubsuit; (1 + 1 + 5 = 7 point match) <br></p>
                    <p class = indentsubtext>A <boldred>Calling the Contractor Match</boldred> requires either 1 Heart card or 1 Spade, either 1 Diamond card or 1 Spade, and 1 Club card of any value. Two spades may be used in a Contractor Match. Spades may not replace Club cards. This match subtracts 1-2 points for each used Spade. <br><br> &rightarrow; Calling the Contractor Match: 3 &heartsuit; + 4 &spadesuit; + 8 &clubsuit; (1 - 1 + 3 = 3 point match) OR 3 &spadesuit; + Q &spadesuit; + 8 &clubsuit; (-1 -2 + 3 = 0 point match)<br></p>
                    <p class = indentsubtext>A <boldred>Perfect Match</boldred> requires 1 Heart card, 1 Diamond card, and 1 Club card of the same face value. This match awards  at least 7 points. If the player can name a Mark, Channel, and Idiom pairing that do perfectly match, they gain an additional +3 points. Named Mark and Channel pairs cannot be repeated within the same game.<br><br> &rightarrow; Perfect Match: 5 &heartsuit; + 5 &diamondsuit; + 5 &clubsuit; (1 + 1 + 3 = 5 point match + 2 perfect match bonus = 7 points total) AND player says: "One way to effectively show trends over time is to use the Line Mark, with the Position Channel, and the Line Chart Idiom." (earns 3 additional points).<br></p>
                    <p class = indentsubtext>A <boldred>Benevolent Contractor Match</boldred> requires 1 Heart or 1 Diamond card, 1 Spade card, and 1 Club card of the same value. This match awards at least 5 points, and is not eligable for gaining an additional +3 points for naming a perfect Mark, Channel, Idiom pairing. <br><br> &rightarrow; Benevolent Contractor Match: 5 &heartsuit; + 5 &spadesuit; + 5 &clubsuit; (1 - 1 + 3 = 3 point match + 2 perfect match bonus = 5 points total) OR J &spadesuit; + J &diamondsuit; + J &clubsuit; (-2 + 2 + 5 = 5 point match + 2 perfect match bonus = 7 points total)</p>

            <p class = subsection>Reflection</p>
            <p class = subtext> I was surprised by how well a standard 52-card deck aligned with the structure of the game. It was exciting to see how simple gameplay mechanics could make abstract data concepts approachable. I also was never extremely concious of the mathematical mechanics behind card games before creating this. In beginning drafts of this game, the players were each dealt 5 cards, then 7, and finally 9 cards. I finally decided on 9 cards because I wanted to make sure there was no trouble with an "odd" card remaining when a player was attemping to win. Additionally, choosing 9 cards made the game last at least a few rounds before a player created matches with all their cards. I used the outcomes of the test games to decide what point values to assign to each type of card. This was a useful strategy, since it was hard to conceptualize how the game would flow before playing it. 
                <br><br> I think this game is a good way to introduce new programmers to Data Visualization concepts. It is simple enough that anyone can play it, but it also has enough depth to be interesting. I hope that by playing this game, people will be able to learn more about Data Visualization and how it can be used in the real world. I also think this game is a good way to review the concepts we learned in class. It is a fun way to test your knowledge, and it is also a good way to see how well you understand the material. I hope that by playing this game, people will be able to learn more about Data Visualization and how it can be used in the real world.
                <br><br> I hope to go to graduate school, and eventually become a professor. I think games like this would be a wonderful way to introduce students to programming concepts in a familiar and approachable way. One of my favorite Statistics professors, who taught me Introduction to Probability Theory, brought games into the classroom to help teach students the underpinings of probability theory. Bringing cards and games into the classroom is definitely possible, and in my experience was a great tool to learn while having fun.
            <p class = subsection>Relevant Artifact Photos</p>
            <p class = subtext> In order to test out this game, I played a few different versions of it with my roommates! They have never been introduced to Data Visualization and do not study computer science or math related fields, but they were still able to follow along and play the game. Because this game does not require much technical knowledge, it can be a good way to connect new programmers to Data Visualization concepts. Below are two images, the first of my roommates and I starting our first game of Club Scrum, and the second of our ending matches after a few warm-up rounds.</p>

    <h2>Curate + Reflect</h2>
        <p class = artifact>Maps & Networks Activity</p>

            <p class = subsection>Reflection</p>
                <p class = subtext>Looking through my classwork over the past semester, I was most proud of this assignment. This is due in part to the fact that this assignment seemed like a puzzle. My solution to this “puzzle” was a bit odd, and definitely not perfect. But, the beauty of this assignment was that no two individuals at my table, or even in the classroom likely had the same solution, as there was no right or wrong way to represent the given data, or complete the given tasks. 
                    <br><br> By completing this assignment, I learned that past fundamental suggestions, data visualization is truly subjective to the creator. For example, it is advised that when you have geospatial data, you should visualize it using a map. However, past the suggestion of having a map, many of the vis design choices that follow are dataset and creator dependent. A creator may follow bad, good, or neutral practices. Their vis may make perfect sense, have good aesthetics, and accurately represent the data. Alternatively, they may choose confusing glyphs, misleading color scales, or use nonsensical dual axes.
                    <br><br>Coming up with effective glyphs is a skillset I hope to continue building on as I continue my data visualization journey. I consistently found myself impressed with in-class examples containing glyphs that genuinely did a great job of portraying data. That being said, in certain cases, I feel glyphs can feel unprofessional, or too “maximalist” for a dry corporate environment. However, I think there is a balance between function and form to be found when using glyphs, as shown in class examples. I hope to continue working towards finding this balance in my future visualizations that include glyphs! (I’m not quite there yet though… don't think stars are acceptable in corporate)</p>

        <p class = artifact>Best Practices: Dashboard Edition</p>
            <p class = subsection>Collection of Best Practices</p> 
            <p class = subtext>
                By no means is this list of Best Practices exhaustive, but it is a good starting point for anyone looking to create a dashboard. These practices are based on the work of my group, and what I came across while working on our final project. I hope that by sharing these practices, I can help others create effective dashboards that are easy to use and understand.
                <br><br>&star; Limiting the number of views in a Dashboard is a good way to ensure that the dashboard is not overwhelming, and includes only what is relevant to the user. Take a moment to reflect on the user's needs, and what they are trying to accomplish. This will help you determine what views are necessary, and which ones can be removed. Additionally, it is important to consider the layout of the dashboard. A good layout will help the user navigate the dashboard easily, and find the information they need quickly.
                <br><br> &star; Use a consistent color scheme throughout the dashboard. This will make the dashboard easier to read. Additionally, is important to be mindful of color pallete selections, especially when data is encoded using color.
                <br><br> &star; Understand the audience's need for feedback mechanisms. If you are aware your dashboard is slow to load, or has a lot of data, it is important to include some sort of feedback, like a loading bar. This will help the user understand that their request is being processed, and that the dashboard is not frozen.
                <br><br> &star; Select and include the correct idioms for the job. This is important because the idioms you choose will determine how the data is presented to the user, and how easy it is to draw conclusions from. For example, if you are trying to show a trend over time, a line chart is a good choice. However, if you are trying to show a relationship between two variables, a scatter plot is a better choice.
                <br><br> &star; Include contextual information. This is important because it helps the user understand what they are looking at, and why it is relevant to them. For example, if you are showing a trend over time, it is important to include the time period that the data covers. This will help the user understand how the data has changed over time, and what factors may have influenced this change. Additionally, including tooltips or hover text can also be useful strategy to provide a user with additional information.
                <br><br> &star; Include interactivity, when feasible. This is important because it allows the user to explore the data in more depth, find the information they are looking for, and establish a connection to the dataset. For example, if you are showing a trend over time, allowing the user to zoom in on a specific time period can help them see the data more clearly. Additionally, including filters or drop-down menus can also be useful in allowing the user to customize their view of the data in order to understand specific trends.
                <br><br> &star; Include multiple visualization types. This is important because it allows the user to see the data from different perspectives, and draw conclusions from multiple points of view. For example, if you are showing a trend over time, including a line chart and a bar chart can help the user see the data in different ways. Additionally, keep in mind the strengths and weaknesses of each idiom. For example, a histogram is a good choice if a user is concerned with the details of the data's distrbution, whereas a boxplot simply reports the median and quartiles and any potential outliers.

            <p class = subsection>Relevant Artifact Photos - Group 3's Dashboard</p>
            <p class = subsection>Reflection</p>
                <p class = subtext>I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio since my group's Final Dashboard was a product of multiple students working together and each contributing what fit under their own set of Best Practices. Curating this list of best practices allowed me the opportunity to question my own contibutions and suggestions to the group, and gave me the opportunity to learn more about dashboard building. Additionally, I wanted to dive deeper, and further analyse what was successful about our dashboard, and what could have been rethought. I am currently an Intern for a Naval Surface Warfare Center in Potomac, Maryland. In this role, I have worked on creating dashboards and other visualizations of data. Therefore, this reflection will also help me in my future work as an intern, and in the professional environment.
                
                <br><br><bold>The Good</bold> </p>
                <p class = indentsubtext> Our final dashboard was mindful of the number of views included. We were able to limit the number of views to 4, which I feel was sufficient to tell the story of our data. Additionally, we included a good amount of interactivity, which allowed the user to select which Large Language Model dataset they wanted to explore in detail. Additionally, users could filter their views by attribute, by selecting buttons. Something unique about our dashboard was the inclusion of the metrics on the left side of the dashboard. This was included to give the user a quick overview of the data by drawing attention to attributes our group selected.</p>
                
                <p class = subtext><bold>The Bad</bold></p>
                <p class = indentsubtext> There was little context given to displayed attributes within the dashboard. For example, the user was not given any information about what the attributes meant, or how they were calculated. This is less of a problem for attributes like "Complexity", but still definitely poses an issue within our dashboard. The meaning of certain attributes, like "SMOG" or "Gunning Fog" are not clear without explanation. Our group did not consider how this would impact the user's understanding of the data, and navigation thoughout the dashboard. Additionally, we did not include any tooltips or hover text, other than to display the executive summary required by the Final Release. Including tooltips or hover text would have been helpful in providing additional information to the user, and could have been implemented to give context to attributes.</p>
                
                <p class = subtext><bold>The Ugly</bold></p>
                <p class = indentsubtext>The color scheme of our dashboard was not consistent, and did not follow best practices. More specifically, in our large ridgeplot, our group opted to have 4 colors repeat throughout the plot. This was done to differentiate between the many attributes displayed in the ridgeline plot, but ended up doing the opposite. Users percieved the colors as being associated with the attributes, and therefore assumed same colored attributes were related. This was not the case, and caused confusion when users were trying to understand the data. Because we did not implement a section of our dashboard dedicated to describing how attributes were calculated, there was no way for users to understand same colored attrbutes were not related. Additionally, similar colors were used to represent each Large Language Model in another ridgeplot. Choosing to utilize the same color pallete to represent both attributes of a dataset and the dataset itself was a poor choice, and did not follow best practices. This is an example of how color can be used to encode data, but also how it can be misused.
