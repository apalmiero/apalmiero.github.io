    <h1>Data Visualization - Individual Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>By Annamaria Pamiero - CMSC436 - Dr. Rebecca Williams</h2>
    <p1>The intent of the following portfolio is to showcase my growth and increased understanding of data visualization throughout the Spring 2025 semester. To do this, I will Refine + Reflect two artifacts: (1) Dear Data Postcard, (2) Original Board Game centered on Marks and Channels. I will also Curate + Reflect on two separate artifacts (1) Maps and Networks in-class activity, (2) Curate a guideline for Dashboard Building "Best Practices". My intent for choosing these specific artifacts were to engage my creativity, showcase work I was proud of, and reflect on my group's Final Dashboard Release.</p1>
