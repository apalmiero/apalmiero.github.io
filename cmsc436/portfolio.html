    <h2>Individual Portfolio</h2>
    <h3>Data Visualization (CMSC436) Dr. Rebecca Williams</h3>
        <p1>The intent of the following portfolio is to showcase my growth and increased understanding of data visualization throughout the Spring 2025 semester. 
        To do this, I will Refine + Reflect on two artifacts: (1) Dear Data Postcard, (2) Original Board Game centered on Marks and Channels. 
        I will also Curate + Reflect on two separate artifacts (1) Maps and Networks in-class activity, (2) Curate a guideline for Dashboard Building "Best Practices". 
        My intent for choosing these specific artifacts were to demonstrate that data visualization can be creative, showcase work I was proud of, and reflect on my group's Final Release (which was in the form of a Dashboard).</p1>
